# Kalman-filter
PLS model correction using Kalman-filter methods
KF-PLS was used for correcting the model coefficients
PLS-KF-KF was used for correcting the model bias. PLS-KF-KF includes kf_function and double_kf. kf_function is the step 1 for smoothing, and double_kf is the step 2 for bias correction.
